                                    <li>The relevant Faculty is able to determine that the coursework was taken at undergraduate level and is at least equivalent to the credit rating available for one module of the programme for which the credit transfer is being considered.</li>
                                    <li>The student attained a minimum GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale or equivalent for the credit of a module to be transferred.</li>

                                    <li>The Faculty only allows exemptions from modules with content equivalent to that qualification providing the transferable points.</li>
                                    <li>Credit points can only be transferred where the work done for the previous qualification would allow the student to successfully perform the assessment exercise for the exempted module.</li>
                                    <li>The decision as to whether a previously taken qualification or credit accumulation serves to exempt a student from a current module rests with the Board of Examiners on the recommendation of the Dean of the Faculty.</li>
