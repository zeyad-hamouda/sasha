                                    <li>The relevant Faculty is able to determine that the coursework was taken at undergraduate level and is at least equivalent to the credit rating available for one module of the programme for which the credit transfer is being considered.</li>
                                    <li>The student attained a minimum GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale or equivalent for the credit of a module to be transferred.</li>

                                    <li>The decision as to whether a previously taken qualification or credit accumulation serves to exempt a student from a current module rests with the Board of Examiners on the recommendation of the Dean of the Faculty.</li>
