                                <p class="para">The Bachelor Degree in(Bsc.) Computer Science – Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides 
                                    you the knowledge to build systems that have intelligent behaviour. There are two 
                                    main directions of research which are followed in the bachelor degree of Artificial 
                                    Intelligence. One is to enable students to comprehend natural intelligence through 
                                    the utilisation of computer models. The other enables students to develop methods 
                                    and innovation to build systems capable of intelligent decisions and actions. In this 
                                    way, the AI that students learn is both a science and an engineering discipline. 
                                    Applications of AI range from ‘smart’ controllers for household devices to computers 
                                    that can converse in natural languages such as English, play computer games, 
                                    conduct intelligent web searches or act as the brain of a robot. We support students 
                                    to get such experiences by giving them the opportunities to participate in study trips 
                                    and internships, both in the UAE and internationally.</p>
