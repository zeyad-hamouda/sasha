                                <p>Psychology is the scientific study of the human experience. A discipline that can be applied to all aspects of everyday life, psychology considers both the internal and external factors that affect people and how we think, behave and develop.

                                    Psychologists are fascinated by the internal functions of the mind, seeking to understand human development and the behavior of individuals, organizations and even nations. Since the time of Ancient Greece, the study of psychology has been at the very foundation of human development and education.
                                    
                                    Today, a degree in psychology is one of the most popular qualifications across the world, with graduates leading in an expanding range of professional fields. Psychologists 
                                    are lifelong learners, influencing individuals, organizations and society as clinical mental health workers, business professionals, organizational psychologists,
                                     social workers, educators and criminal justice advocates, among other professions.</p>
